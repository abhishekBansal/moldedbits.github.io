After a month of hard work, we are ready with the beta version of our
first game for Android, Bumble.

Bumble is a fun and challenging word game with a unique take on anagrams.
Burst the bubbles carrying alphabets in the right order to make dictionary
words, all while racing against the clock.

We are currently working on making some awesome game art. In the
mean while you can try [Bumble](http://moldedbits.com/index.php/portfolio/bumble-2/) with minimalistic graphics. We would love your feedback.

Cheers!
