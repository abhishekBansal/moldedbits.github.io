R2D2 is an open source android library which helps the user to store sensitive data in android without using SharedPreference.

#### Problem
In one of our app we needed to store user credentials so that user donâ€™t have to type username and password every time he wants to login and just type in a pin code which can be used to get username and password. SharedPreference was not an option as information from the SharedPreference can be easily extracted by rooting the phone.

#### Solution
R2D2 uses android key store to store the key used for encrypting and decrypting the data thus making it impossible for anyone to retrieve the sensitive data.
Since api for encryption varies widely for different versions of android it is difficult and time consuming to implement something which is secure over all the versions of android above api level 16(*anyhow who uses api below 16*) So we have created a library which takes care of all the nitty-gritty technicalities of encryption so that you can focus on the main aspects of the app.

#### Integrating in your app
It is very simple to use, you just need to initialize R2D2 and call the encryptData and decryptData function and you can enjoy your sound sleep knowing that your data is safe.

For initializing you need to pass the context and a keyAlias. **It is highly recommended that you get the keyAlias either from the user (may be in form of pin) or from the api.**

##### Initializing R2D2
{% highlight java %}
R2D2 r2d2 = new R2D2(context, keyAlias);
{% endhighlight %}

##### For Encryption
{% highlight java %}
void setPassword(String password) {
        String encrypted = r2d2.encryptData(password);
        if (encrypted != null && !encrypted.equalsIgnoreCase("")) {
            password = encrypted;
        }
        SharedPreferences.Editor editor = preferences.edit();
        editor.putString(KEY_PASSWORD, password);
        editor.apply();
    }
{% endhighlight %}
##### For Decryption
{% highlight java %}
String getPassword() {
        String password = preferences.getString(KEY_PASSWORD, null);
        String decrypted = r2d2.decryptData(password);
        if (decrypted != null && !decrypted.equalsIgnoreCase("")) {
            password = decrypted;
        }
        return password;
    }
{% endhighlight %}
