Yep, its finally out on the Android Market.

We have had an awesome time working on this one, we hope you love it as much as we do.
Bumble is an addictive word game, it is how anagrams are supposed to be played.

Bumble is completely free of charge, and will always remain so. There are no ads, no hidden costs
and you will never have to pay for any new features.

Bumble was made using the awesome [libgdx](http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/) framework. If you plan on making games for
Android, we suggest you check them out.

If you love Bumble, do spread the word. It means a lot to us.
